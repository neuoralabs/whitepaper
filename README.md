## Revolutionizing AI with Decentralized Intelligence

### Introduction
Neuora Framework is a modular, decentralized AI framework designed to empower autonomous agents with advanced capabilities such as reinforcement learning, swarm intelligence, multi-modal processing, blockchain interaction, and democratic decision-making. This project isn’t just a framework; it’s a showcase of collaborative innovation between human creators and AI agents. Every component of this system has been conceptualized, designed, and refined through the synergy of human oversight and machine intelligence.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous AI Agents** – Modular, scalable, and capable of decentralized operation.
- **Swarm Intelligence** – Consensus-driven decision-making using Redis and Lua scripts.
- **Multi-Modal AI** – Processes text, images, and audio for diverse applications.
- **Blockchain Integration** – Full support for Solana and Ethereum networks.
- **Decentralized Storage** – IPFS-powered file storage and retrieval.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Self-optimization for improved task efficiency.
- **Swarm Consensus** – Distributed decision-making for trustless operations.
- **Task Queues & Collaboration** – Multi-agent orchestration frameworks.
- **Decentralized Governance** – Token-based democratic voting systems.

### Why Neuora?
